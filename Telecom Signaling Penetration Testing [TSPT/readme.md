What is
Telecom Signaling Penetration Testing
The telecom industry has grown at a breakneck pace, particularly in Asia, Africa, and South America's developing nations. This has resulted in rapid network development, the addition of value-added services, and an increase in the setup's overall complexity. Unfortunately, security is frequently overlooked or put on the backburner to increase market share and reduce costs. On the other hand, cybercriminals are unconcerned about such economic realities, and they have begun attacking telecom infrastructure, particularly as it migrates to an IP-based architecture with the advent of LTE.

Together with tightening telecom security regulations, this has created a significant barrier for carriers to overcome. However, while there are numerous security challenges, our experience with telcos has shown that some are solvable, while others will continue to pose recognised threats until cost-effective solutions are developed.



Our approach to Telecom Signaling Penetration Testing


Pre Engagement
Conduct a preliminary company analysis better to understand the business processes and the surrounding world, and then narrow the scope accordingly.




Scoping
To identify the scope (People, Process, and Technology) as applicable, our consultants will first understand your business processes, controls, and systems.




Classification of Critical Assets
Identify the critical information assets and identify them appropriately to create a separate inventory of them.



Risk Assessment
This is the most critical stage of implementation because it is during this stage that an asset register containing all of the organisation's information assets is created. This process entails meeting and conversing with your organisation's key stakeholders. The critical information assets are then subjected to a comprehensive risk assessment, from which appropriate controls to mitigate identified risks are selected.



Risk Treatment
Our Consultants classify identified risks and assist you in strategising appropriate Risk Treatment measures.


Vulnerability Analysis
Our cyber security expert identifies potential flaws in hotels INFRASTRUCTURE & critical assets and recommends steps to mitigate the risk.


Penetration Testing
Testing the resilience of your barriers is critical to ensuring the security of your assets. Our penetration testing ensures that your systems and procedures are evaluated thoroughly and effectively.



Employee Training
Our classroom instruction includes classes on general awareness, management, technological skills, and hacking. Our e-learning solution may be delivered onboard or in the office, enabling your personnel to address critical components of any cyber security system - including the human factor.


Report Submission
Once the assessment is complete, a detailed written report outlining each observed and or exploited vulnerability, along with the root cause analysis and categorisation along with mitigation and confirmatory retest certificate if the need arrives.


Support
What really makes us stand apart is our excellent and round the clock support, making sure our clients never have to witness hurdles in the business.

Why
Telecom Signaling Penetration Testing
Penetration testing your telecom network on a regular basis enables you to assess your organization's capability and endurance in protecting the network, systems, endpoints, and users from current and emerging internal and external threats.

Threats to Telecom Security: The most serious threats to telecom security are often divided into the following categories:

Toll fraud
Information harvesting & theft
2FA interception
Call interception
Location tracking
Banking / Billing / VAS fraud
Premium rate fraud
Malware
Spam
Denial of service attacks
Data leakage
